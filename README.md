# Enhanced Infinity Kaleidoscope (Three.js 3D & p5.js 2D)

This project is an interactive, browser-based kaleidoscope drawing tool that lets you create mesmerizing symmetrical art in both 2D and 3D. It combines the creative power of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for 2D drawing and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D visualization, all within a single, modern web interface.

## Features

- **2D & 3D Drawing Modes:** Instantly switch between 2D (p5.js) and 3D (Three.js) kaleidoscope drawing.
- **Symmetry Control:** Adjust the number of symmetry segments (2–64) for intricate patterns.
- **Shape & Effect Modes:** Choose from lines, circles, triangles, curves, particles, and noise lines, with multiple visual effects (pulsating, color cycling, jitter, etc).
- **Color Palettes:** Select from dynamic and themed color palettes (Ocean, Sunset, Forest, Nebula, Monochrome, Neon).
- **Auto Draw:** Enable auto-draw for generative, animated patterns.
- **Canvas Controls:** Clear the canvas, save your artwork as a PNG, and pan the 2D canvas.
- **Responsive UI:** Modern, mobile-friendly control panel with live value displays.

## Usage

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
2. Use the **Menu** button to open the control panel.
3. Adjust symmetry, brush size, effects, and palette as desired.
4. Draw with your mouse or touch (in 2D), or click in 3D mode to add shapes.
5. Switch between 2D and 3D modes with the **Mode** button.
6. Use **Auto Draw** for generative art, and **Save Image** to download your creation.

## Technologies Used

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for 2D drawing
